Practice Task #2
================

## Organization of Work

It is recommended to create a separate directory to keep all your course work in
one place.

### Directory Organization Example

```

## Task #1: Absolute Value

Write a program that reads a real number and outputs its absolute value.

### Examples

```cpp
Enter a real number: -123.345
|-123.345| = 123.345
```

```cpp
Enter a real number: 12.4
|12.4| = 12.4
```

## Task #2: Dangerous Comparison

Create a variable of type double that is equals to 0. Add 0.1 to this variable 10 times.
Compare the final values with 1.0. If the values are equal, output "Equal", if the values
are not equal, output "Not equal". Check the result of the program. Find out how to fix
the program to output a correct result.

## Task #3: The Maximum of Two

The program reads two integer numbers and finds out which one is the maximum number.

### Examples

```cpp
Enter the first number: 123
Enter the second number: 56
The first number 123 is greater than the second number 56.
```

```cpp
Enter the first number: 423
Enter the second number: 1122
The second number 1122 is greater than the first number 423.
```

## Task #4: The Maximum Value of Three

The program reads three numbers and finds the maximum value between them.

### Examples

```cpp
Enter the first number: 12
Enter the second number: 7
Enter the third number: 539
The maximum value is 539.
```

```cpp
Enter the first number: 74
Enter the second number: 23
Enter the third number: 23
The maximum value is 74.
```

## Task #5: Leap Year

The program finds out whether the entered year is leap or not.

### Test Data

#### Leap Years

1796, 1804, 1896, 1904, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008

#### Common Years

1799, 1800, 1801, 1802, 1803, 1805, 1899, 1900, 1901

### Examples

```cpp
Enter the year: 2000
2000 is a leap year.
```

```cpp
Enter the year: 1800
1800 is a common year.
```

## Task #6: Grades

Write a program that finds out an equivalent letter grade for a given number grade.

### Conversion Table

```cpp
90 <= A <= 100
80 <= B < 90
70 <= C < 80
60 <= D < 70
Less than 60: F
```

### Examples

```cpp
Enter a number of points: 73
Grade: C
```

```cpp
Enter a number of points: 120
The number 120 is incorrect.
```

## Task #7: Season Name (if-else if)

Write a program to find out a season name for a given month number. Use the `if`
statement for this task.

### Examples

```cpp
Enter the month name: 12
Winter
```

```cpp
Enter the month name: 3
Spring
```

## Task #8: Season Name (switch)

Rewrite the previous program to use the `switch` statement.

```cpp
Enter a four-digit integer: 1237
The sum of all its digits is 13
```

## Task #9: Number of Days

Find out the number of days for a given month and year.

```cpp
Enter the year: 2000
Enter the month number: 2
29
```

```cpp
Enter the year: 1900
Enter the month number: 2
28
```

```cpp
Enter the year: 2004
Enter the month number: 4
30
```
