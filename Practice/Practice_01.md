## Organization of Work

It is recommended to create a separate directory to keep all your course work in
one place.

### Directory Organization Example

## Task #1: First Program

Write a program that outputs the "hello, world" message to the screen.

### Example

```cpp
hello, world
```

## Task #2: Message in a Box

Print the message from the previous task inside of a box of `*` characters.

### Example

```cpp
**************
*hello, world*
**************
```

## Task #3: Greeting

Ask for a user name in your program. Output a greeting message together with the
name of the user.

### Example

```cpp
What is your name? Dmitrii
Hi, Dmitrii!
```

## Task #4: Sum of Numbers

Ask for two integer numbers. Find and print the sum of these numbers.

### Example

```cpp
Enter the first number: 17
Enter the second number: 25
17 + 25 = 42
```

## Task #5: Volume of a Rectangular Parallelepiped

Create a program that reads 3 integer values that represent sides of a
rectangular parallelepiped and prints its volume based on those values.

### Example

```cpp
Enter the length of the first side: 4
Enter the length of the second side: 3
Enter the length of the third side: 5
The volume of the parallelepiped of size 4 x 3 x 5 is equal to 60.
```

## Task #6: Swap Two Numbers

Create a program that reads two numbers into two variables `a` and `b`.
The program should print the values stored inside the variables, then
swap them, then print the values again.

### Example

```cpp
Enter the first value: 2
Enter the second value: 3
Before swapping: a = 2; b = 3;
After swapping: a = 3; b = 2;
```

## Task #7: Swap Two Numbers (2)

Modify the program from task #6 to only use 2 variables to swap numbers.

## Task #8: Sum of Digits

Read a four-digit integer from the user and find the sum of all its digits.

```cpp
Enter a four-digit integer: 1237
The sum of all its digits is 13
```

## Task #9: Inches to Centimeters Conversion

Create an application that converts a specific value consumed from the console from
inches to centimeters.

Note that 1 in. equals to 2.54 cm.

```cpp
Enter the length in inches: 17
17 in. = 43.18 cm.
```

## Task #10: Fahrenheit to Celsius Conversion

Create an application that can perform Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion.

`[°C] = 5⁄9 * ([°F] − 32)`

```cpp
Enter the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit: 114
The temperature in degrees Celsius is 45.56
```
